- To begin with, start a redis server using: redis-server
- check if the default port is 6379 or not
- once the redis connection is established, we can run bullBoard/index.js to start the bullBoard UI
  on port 4000
- now we can run the other jobs present in different version of bullMQ/index-version_number.js

****
Now to stop the redis-server:
lsof -i tcp:{PORT}
kill -9 {PORT_ID}




****
To check if redis server is up & running:
- try redis-cli>PING
- replies PONG
